<b> &#9758 1628 </b>English physician William Harvey discovers the circulation of blood. Shortly afterward, the earliest known blood transfusion is attempted.

<br><br> The first recorded successful blood transfusion occurs in England: Physician Richard Lower keeps dogs alive by transfusion of blood from other dogs.

<br><br><b>  &#9758 1667</b> Jean-Baptiste Denis in France and Richard Lower in England separately report successful transfusions from lambs to humans. Within 10 years, transfusing the blood of animals to humans becomes prohibited by law because of reactions.

<br><br><b>  &#9758 1795 </b>In Philadelphia, American physician Philip Syng Physick, performs the first human blood transfusion, although he does not publish this information.

<br><br><b> &#9758 1818</b> James Blundell, a British obstetrician, performs the first successful transfusion of human blood to a patient for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Using the patient's husband as a donor, he extracts approximately four ounces of blood from the husband's arm and, using a syringe, successfully transfuses the wife. Between 1825 and 1830, he performs 10 transfusions, five of which prove beneficial to his patients, and publishes these results. He also devises various instruments for performing transfusions and proposed rational indications.


<br><br><b>&#9758 1840</b> At St. George's School in London, Samuel Armstrong Lane, aided by consultant Dr. Blundell, performs the first successful whole blood transfusion to treat hemophilia.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1867</b> English surgeon Joseph Lister uses antiseptics to control infection during transfusions.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1873-1880</b> US physicians transfuse milk (from cows, goats, and humans).

<br><br><b>&#9758 1884</b> Saline infusion replaces milk as a “blood substitute” due to the increased frequency of adverse reactions to milk.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1900 </b>Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician, discovers the first three human blood groups, A, B, and C. Blood type C was later changed to O. His colleagues Alfred Decastello and Adriano Sturli add AB, the fourth type, in 1902. Landsteiner receives the Nobel Prize for Medicine for this discovery in 1930.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1907</b> Hektoen suggests that the safety of transfusion might be improved by crossmatching blood between donors and patients to exclude incompatible mixtures. Reuben Ottenberg performs the first blood transfusion using blood typing and crossmatching in New York. Ottenberg also observed the mendelian inheritance of blood groups and recognized the “universal” utility of group O donors.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1908</b>French surgeon Alexis Carrel devises a way to prevent clotting by sewing the vein of the recipient directly to the artery of the donor. This vein-to-vein or direct method, known as anastomosis, is practiced by a number of physicians, among them J.B. Murphy in Chicago and George Crile in Cleveland. The procedure proves unfeasible for blood transfusions, but paves the way for successful organ transplantation, for which Carrel receives the Nobel Prize in 1912.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1908 </b>Moreschi describes the antiglobulin reaction. The antiglobulin is a direct way of visualizing an antigen-antibody reaction that has taken place but is not directly visible. The antigen and antibody react with each other, then, after washing to remove any unbound antibody, the antiglobulin reagent is added and binds between the antibody molecules that are stuck onto the antigen. This makes the complex big enough to see.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1912 </b>Roger Lee, a visiting physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital, along with Paul Dudley White, develops the Lee-White clotting time. Adding another important discovery to the growing body of knowledge of transfusion medicine, Lee demonstrates that it is safe to give group O blood to patients of any blood group, and that blood from all groups can be given to group AB patients. The terms "universal donor" and "universal recipient" are coined.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1914</b> Long-term anticoagulants, among them sodium citrate, are developed, allowing longer preservation of blood.

<br><br><b>&#9758  1915</b> At Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, Richard Lewisohn uses sodium citrate as an anticoagulant to transform the transfusion procedure from direct to indirect. In addition, Richard Weil demonstrates the feasibility of refrigerated storage of such anticoagulated blood. Although this is a great advance in transfusion medicine, it takes 10 years for sodium citrate use to be accepted.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1916</b> Francis Rous and J.R.Turner introduce a citrate-glucose solution that permits storage of blood for several days after collection. Allowing for blood to be stored in containers for later transfusion aids the transition from the vein-to-vein method to indirect transfusion. This discovery also allows for the establishment of the first blood depot by the British during World War I. Oswald Robertson, an American Army officer, is credited with creating the blood depots. Robertson received the AABB Landsteiner Award in 1958 as developer of the first blood bank.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1927-1947</b> The MNSs and P systems are discovered. MNSs and P are two more blood group antigen systems — just as ABO is one system and Rh is another.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1932 </b> first blood bank is established in a Leningrad hospital.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1937</b> Bernard Fantus, director of therapeutics at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, establishes the first hospital blood bank in the United States. In creating a hospital laboratory that can preserve and store donor blood, Fantus originates the term "blood bank." Within a few years, hospital and community blood banks begin to be established across the United States. Some of the earliest are in San Francisco, New York, Miami, and Cincinnati.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1939/40 </b>The Rh blood group system is discovered by Karl Landsteiner, Alex Wiener, Philip Levine, and R.E. Stetson and is soon recognized as the cause of the majority of transfusion reactions. Identification of the Rh factor takes its place next to the discovery of ABO as one of the most important breakthroughs in the field of blood banking.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1940 </b>Edwin Cohn, a professor of biological chemistry at Harvard Medical School, develops cold ethanol fractionation, the process of breaking down plasma into components and products. Albumin, a protein with powerful osmotic properties, plus gamma globulin and fibrinogen are isolated and become available for clinical use. John Elliott develops the first blood container, a vacuum bottle extensively used by the Red Cross.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1940 </b>The United States government establishes a nationwide program for the collection of blood. Charles R. Drew develops the “Plasma for Britain” program — a pilot project to collect blood for shipment to the British Isles. The American Red Cross participates, collecting 13 million units of blood by the end of World War II.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1941</b> Isodor Ravdin, a prominent surgeon from Philadelphia, effectively treats victims of the Pearl Harbor attack with Cohn's albumin for shock. Injected into the blood stream, albumin absorbs liquid from surrounding tissues, preventing blood vessels from collapsing, a finding associated with shock.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1943</b>The introduction by J.F. Loutit and Patrick L. Mollison of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution, which reduces the volume of anticoagulant, permits transfusions of greater volumes of blood and permits longer term storage.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1943 </b>P. Beeson publishes the classic description of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1945 </b> Coombs, Mourant, and Race describe the use of antihuman globulin (later known as the “Coombs Test”) to identify “incomplete” antibodies.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1947 </b> The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is formed to promote common goals among blood banking practitioners and the blood donating public.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1949-1950</b>  The US blood collection system includes 1,500 hospital blood banks, 46 community blood centers, and 31 American Red Cross regional blood centers.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1950 </b> Audrey Smith reports the use of glycerol cryoprotectant for freezing red blood cells.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1950</b>  In one of the single most influential technical developments in blood banking, Carl Walter and W.P. Murphy, Jr., introduce the plastic bag for blood collection. Replacing breakable glass bottles with durable plastic bags allows for the evolution of a collection system capable of safe and easy preparation of multiple blood components from a single unit of whole blood. Development of the refrigerated centrifuge in 1953 further expedites blood component therapy.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1953</b>  The AABB Clearinghouse is established, providing a centralized system for exchanging blood among blood banks. Today, the Clearinghouse is called the National Blood Exchange.

<br><br><b>&#9758 Mid-1950s </b> In response to the heightened demand created by open-heart surgery and advances in trauma care patients, blood use enters its most explosive growth period.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1957 </b> The AABB forms its committee on Inspection and Accreditation to monitor the implementation of standards for blood banking.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1958</b>  The AABB publishes its first edition of Standards for a Blood Transfusion Service (now titled Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services).

<br><br><b>&#9758 1959</b>  Max Perutz of Cambridge University deciphers the molecular structure of hemoglobin, the molecule that transports oxygen and gives red blood cells their color.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1960 </b> The AABB begins publication of TRANSFUSION, the first American journal wholly devoted to the science of blood banking and transfusion technology. In this same year, A. Solomon and J.L. Fahey report the first therapeutic plasmapheresis procedure — a procedure that separates whole blood into plasma and red blood cells.

<br><br><b></b>&#9758 1961 </b> The role of platelet concentrates in reducing mortality from hemorrhage in cancer patients is recognized.
<br><br><b></b>&#9758 1961</b>  The role of platelet concentrates in reducing mortality from hemorrhage in cancer patients is recognized.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1962 </b> The first antihemophilic factor (AHF) concentrate to treat coagulation disorders in hemophilia patients is developed through fractionation.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1962 </b> In the US, there were 4,400 hospital blood banks, 123 community blood centers and 55 American Red Cross blood centers, collecting a total of five to six million units of blood per year.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1964</b>  Plasmapheresis is introduced as a means of collecting plasma for fractionation.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1965</b>  Judith G. Pool and Angela E. Shannon report a method for producing Cryoprecipitated AHF for treatment of hemophilia.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1967 </b> Rh immune globulin is commercially introduced to prevent Rh disease in the newborns of Rh-negative women.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1969 </b> S. Murphy and F. Gardner demonstrate the feasibility of storing Platelets at room temperature, revolutionizing platelet transfusion therapy.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1970 </b> Blood banks move toward an all-volunteer blood donor system.

<br><br><b>&#9758 1971</b>  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) testing of donated blood begins.

<br><br><b>1&#9758 972</b>  Apheresis is used to extract one cellular component, returning the rest of the blood to the donor.

<br><br> A new anticoagulant preservative, CPDA-1, extends the shelf life of whole blood and red blood cells to 35 days, increasing the blood supply and facilitating resource sharing among blood banks.

<br><br><b>&#9758 Early 1980s</b>  With the growth of component therapy, products for coagulation disorders, and plasma exchange for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, hospital and community blood banks enter the era of transfusion medicine, in which doctors trained specifically in blood transfusion actively participate in patient care.
