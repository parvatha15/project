<h1>FACTS</h1>
<p>
<b>
<ul>
  <li>Every year our nation requires about 5 Crore units of blood, out of which only a major 2.5 Crore units of blood are available.</li>
  <li>Gift of blood is the gift of life.</li><li> There is no substitute for human blood.
Every two seconds someone needs blood.
     More than 38,000 blood donations are needed every day.</li>
  <li> Total of 30 million blood components are transfused each year.</li>
  <li> Average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 points.</li>
  <li> Blood type most often requested by hospitals is Type O.</li>
  <li> When you donate regularly, it gives you the opportunity to save multiple lives. Burning calories. No, blood donation won't become a weight loss fad any time soon. However, researchers at the University of California, San Diego have found that you can lose up to 650 calories per pint of blood donated.</li>
  <li>The major human blood groups â€“ A, B, AB, and O were first identified and classified by Dr. Karl Landsteiner in 1901. The Red blood cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate are the four types of transfusable products that can be derived from blood.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is blood grouped?</h2>
<li><b>The blood is screened for the following diseases/infections before grouping:
 HIV
 Hepatitis B & C
 Syphilis
 Malaria
</li>
</b>

<h2>Suspended in the plasma are three types of cells</h2>
<b>
<ul>
  <li>Red cells - these carry oxygen</li>
  <li>White cells - these fight infection</li>
  <li>Platelets - these stop wounds bleeding</li>

<li>The most common type of grouping is the ABO grouping.
Red blood cells have a protein coat on their surface, which distinguishes them. 
According to this blood is divided into four groups:</li>
  <li> A (A protein is present),</li> 
  <li>B (B protein is present), </li>
  <li>AB (AB protein is present) and O (no protein is present).</li>

 <li>There are subtypes under this grouping (listed as A1, A2, A1B or A2B) some of which are quite rare.
 Apart from this there is another protein, which plays an important part in the grouping of blood. 
 This is called the Rh factor. 
 If this is present, the particular blood type is called positive. 
 If it is absent, it is called negative. 
 Thus we have the following broad categories:</li>
</ul>
</b>

<ul>
<b>
<li> Negative</li>
<li>A1 Positive</li>
<li>A1B Negative</li>
<li>A1B Positive</li>
<li>A2 Negative</li>
<li>A2 Positive</li>
<li>A2B Negative</li>
<li>A2B Positive</li>
<li>B Negative</li>
<li>B Positive</li>
<li>O Negative</li>
<li>O Positive</li>
</b>
</ul>

<h2>Tips on Blood Donating</h2>
 
<li><b>Please have a good meal at least 3 hours before donating blood.
Please accept the snacks offered after the donation. It is recommended to have a good meal later.
Please avoid smoking on the day before donating. One can smoke 3 hours after donation.
One is not eligible to donate blood if you have consumed alcohol 48 hours before donation.</b></li>
</ul>

<summary><h2>Misconception about Donating Blood</h2></summary>
 
<p><b> will not feel drained or tired if you continue to drink fluids and have a good meal.
You can resume your normal activities after donating blood, though you are asked to refrain from exercise or heavy weight lifting for twelve hours after donation.
Donating blood will not leave you low of blood; in fact you will still have surplus blood after the donation.
While donating blood you will not feel any pain.
You will not faint or feel uncomfortable after donating blood. This is a common misconception.
You will not get AIDS if you donate blood.
Patients are just like donors - most of them have common blood types. Because your blood type is common, the demand for that type is greater than for rare types. So, even if your blood type is common there is still a requirement.

  <summary><h2>Reason for denoting blood?</h2></summary>
  <p><b>There is tremendous demand for blood in hospitals.

    The blood donated is used to:
    Replace blood lost during injury as in accidents.
    Replace blood loss during major surgeries.
    Help patients with blood disorders like haemophilia survive.
    Help burnt patients receive plasma that may be critical for their survival.
    Raise haemoglobin levels (through transfusions) in patients with chronic ailments like kidney diseases, cancer and anaemia.</b>
    </p>
</details>

<details>
   <summary><h2>How often can one donate blood?</h2></summary>
    <p><b>The minimum time advised between two donations is 3 months.
